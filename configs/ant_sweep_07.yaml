  steps_per_iteration: 20_000 # Number of real env steps to collect per iteration before fitting the dynamics model.
  iterations: 5 # Total number of iterations to run

  planner:
    type: "cem" # Planner algorithm; rs, cem 
    horizon: 15 # length of each candidate action sequence evaluated by the planner.

    discount: 0.99 # Reward discount factor inside planning rollouts
    num_cem_iters: 4      # CEM iterations per MPC step. Total model rollouts per MPC step ≈ n_candidates * num_cem_iters.

    alpha: 0.20            # Smoothing for mean/std updates (with your code: 0.1 = move 10% toward elites, keep 90% previous).
